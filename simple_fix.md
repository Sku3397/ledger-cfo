# Simple Fix Instructions

## Problem
Your `.env` file is corrupted with invalid encoding, causing errors when loading configuration.

## Simple Solution

1. **Delete the corrupted .env file**:
   - Find the `.env` file in your CFO_Agent folder
   - Delete it or rename it to something else (like `.env.old`)

2. **Rename the new file**:
   - Rename `new_env.txt` to `.env` (exactly that, with the dot at the start)

3. **Key Changes Made**:
   - Changed `EMAIL_CHECK_INTERVAL` from 60 to 1 (checks every 1 second instead of 60)
   - Fixed the file encoding (now uses proper UTF-8)

4. **Start your app normally**:
   - Run the app the way you normally do

That's it! This should fix the errors without requiring any Python scripts or complex fixes.

## Note
The `EMAIL_CHECK_INTERVAL=1` setting makes the app check for new emails every 1 second instead of every 60 seconds. This gives you near-instant email notifications without requiring webhooks or other complex setups.
