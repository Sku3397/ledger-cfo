# Deployment Verification

## Summary

The CFO Agent has been successfully deployed to Google Cloud Run in the `us-east4` region. The deployment involved:

1. Creating IAM permissions scripts to grant necessary roles
2. Building and deploying the container image
3. Configuring the Cloud Run service for public access

## Service Information

- **Service Name**: ledger
- **Project**: ledger-457022
- **Region**: us-east4
- **URL**: https://ledger-479134170399.us-east4.run.app

## IAM Permissions Applied

The following IAM permissions were granted:

- **Compute Engine default service account** (`479134170399-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com`):
  - `roles/artifactregistry.writer` - Allows pushing to Artifact Registry
  - `roles/logging.logWriter` - Allows writing logs to Cloud Logging

- **Cloud Build service account** (`479134170399@cloudbuild.gserviceaccount.com`):
  - `roles/artifactregistry.writer` - Allows pushing to Artifact Registry
  - `roles/logging.logWriter` - Allows writing logs to Cloud Logging

- **Cloud Run service** (`ledger`):
  - `roles/run.invoker` for `allUsers` - Allows public access to the service

## Build and Deploy Process

The build and deploy process used these commands:

```bash
# Build and push the container image
gcloud builds submit --project=ledger-457022 --tag=us-east4-docker.pkg.dev/ledger-457022/cfo-agent-repo/ledger:latest .

# Deploy to Cloud Run
gcloud run deploy ledger --image=us-east4-docker.pkg.dev/ledger-457022/cfo-agent-repo/ledger:latest --platform=managed --region=us-east4 --project=ledger-457022 --allow-unauthenticated

# Grant public access (if needed)
gcloud beta run services add-iam-policy-binding --region=us-east4 --member=allUsers --role=roles/run.invoker ledger
```

## Verification

The deployment was successful, and the service is now running and publicly accessible at the URL mentioned above.

## Next Steps

1. Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions using the provided workflow file
2. Set up monitoring and alerts for the service
3. Implement proper secret management using Secret Manager
4. Configure regular backups of data if applicable

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with the deployment, check:

1. IAM permissions using the scripts in the `scripts/` directory
2. Cloud Run service logs using:
   ```bash
   gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=ledger" --project=ledger-457022 --limit=10
   ```
3. Container build logs in Cloud Build history
